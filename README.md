# Pfizer Stock Price Prediction with Biotech Events

This project analyzes Pfizer's stock price movements and their relationship with biotechnology-related events such as clinical trial results, FDA approvals, and new drug launches. The goal is to predict stock price changes based on these events, demonstrating how **data science** and **machine learning** can be applied to the **biotech industry**.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, I used Pfizer's historical stock data to train a **Random Forest Regressor** model that predicts stock price changes. The model incorporates various features, including **lagged stock prices**, **30-day moving averages**, **volatility**, and **sentiment scores**.

Key milestones in the **biotech industry**, such as **FDA approvals**, **clinical trial successes**, and **vaccine efficacy results**, were marked as **key events** on the stock price chart to see if they had any impact on stock price movements.
